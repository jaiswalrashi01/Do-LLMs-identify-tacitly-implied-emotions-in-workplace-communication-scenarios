However, the situation suggests underlying frustration due to the failure to report performance issues timely, necessitating HR intervention.

GPT-4o and Phi-3 demonstrate the highest per-emotion agreement when they can generate free-form responses. This consistency decreases when they are forced to categorize into a fixed list, revealing differences in their interpretation of specific emotion labels. Even if they don't perfectly match humans, these consistent AI responses might represent a form of computational consensus. They indicate that these models are processing information in somewhat similar ways to arrive at their emotional conclusions."
